======
Intro
======

TTT is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in ruby and crudely implemented with Ruby on Rails.

The game code logic is in the "engine" folder where each file represents a class:
	game.rb
	board.rb
	player.rb
	
and  all classes are grouped under a single namespace (module) - TTTLogic

"Player" is a superclass for "Human" and "AI" classes.

Implementation of minimax is inspired by Dr. C. Barski's "Land of Lisp : learn to program in Lisp, one game at a time!"


===================
Current Limitations
===================
1. Stores an instance of the game in session cookies
2. AI always starts first
3. User is always "X"
4. Reloads the page to get URL param to identify human's move. It should probably be fully implemented w/ .js ajax


======================
Description of Classes
======================

"Board" class attributes and methods:
	
	size - defaults to 3 and represents the size of the board - 3x3
	field - an array of size^2 that represents a snapshot of players' tile positions on the board
	all_moves - a growing array that holds a tile # for each move made
	
	mark_tile - represents a "move" made by a player
	unmark_last_tile - undo of last mark_tile
	winner_mark - returns a mark that won the game
	draw? - if the game is a draw
	gameover? - if the game is finished we have a winner or it is a draw

"AI" a subclass of Player:
	
	marks tiles with "O"
	max_move, min_move , score_rank - an implementation of minimax game tree algorithm 
	move - marking a position calculated by minimax
